The item warnings are warnings in the console if you tried to get item info of an item that doesn't exist in the database. For example: itemid('goldddcoin'). This would raise a warning message, because 'goldddcoin' wasn't found in the bot's database.",

			"exDescription": "This will beep if the item 'Abyssador Slash' has been found in your backpack, however this item doesn't exist, it was spelled wrong (the correct name is \"Abyssador's Lash\"). But setitemwarnings disabled the item error message, so the console didn't show it. By default, item warnings are always enabled in the bot."
